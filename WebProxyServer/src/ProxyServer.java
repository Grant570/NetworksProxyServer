 * Program Description:
 Step 2 -  Developing a primitive web server
 Write a primitive Java web server that would just get back to a client's
 (i.e. web browser's) request with a 404 response, i.e. resource not found.
 Your server, however, needs to be able to capture the client's request in
 full and output it on the command line.
